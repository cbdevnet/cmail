store-Router user database handling needs to be rewritten
Alias handling was done in path_resolve, should now probably be done in route_inbound
Originating router is now a member of the client structure, proper memory release and acquiry must be observed
All store routers need to check for user existence
Unauthorized outbound paths need to be rejected in early communication (needs originating_router)
Originating reverse paths need to be tested against the outbound routing setup
