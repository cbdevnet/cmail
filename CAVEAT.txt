A collection and discussion of pitfalls in cmail
that might not be immediately evident.

Database schema versioning
--------------------------
The 'meta' table contains a key describing the
current database schema version. The schema is,
as of currently, extremely volatile and might
change between versions, commits and without
notice. Upgrade paths will be provided for point
releases.

Infinite alias recursion
------------------------
It is currently possible to have users be aliased
to other aliased users, including the original user.
This creates an inifinite loop at the time the
alias is resolved (mail routing). Aliases should
for the time being only be created by administrators,
not directly b end users.
