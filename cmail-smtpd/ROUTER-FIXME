MAILPATH->resolved_user is used for validity checking multiple times
store-Router user database handling needs to be rewritten
Alias handling was done in path_resolve, should now probably be done in route_inbound
Originating router is now a member of the client structure, proper memory release and acquiry must be observed
	This member should probably also be used in some resolved_user checks
	This member needs to be set by the initialization routine (to the routing data of the authorized user)
All store routers need to check for user existence
Need to check all route_free calls as to not have invalid memory accesses
Unauthorized outbound paths need to be rejected in early communication (needs originating_router)
