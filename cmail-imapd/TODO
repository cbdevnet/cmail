Test sending literal string with CR's followed by out-of-literal LF (kind of illegal, but does it trigger the nextline parser?)
Create cmail-admin tool and documentation
Create website section
Enable main makefile sections
Test literal strings without waiting for continuation -> Works, but probably should not
Test all commands with NULL parameters
Error check pthread_ calls
Check failscore in queue purge
Queue worker needs to be able to modify client connection score
Sync mailbox UIDVALIDITY drift between user/master databases

Design:
	1 handler/1 worker thread
		Worker needs to keep all user data
	1 handler/MAX_CONC workers
		Worker thread handles 1 user

User INBOX UIDVALIDITY in users table
Remove the parent field from IMAP mailbox table, as relations can only be properly assessed from the name anyway...
Restructure command response handling / pass a command_response structure to be filled
	This allows discards when another function fails the transaction
	Might also include a tag for function identification
	This could also include returning a failscore modifier
Refactor backend command handling
	handlers -> Process queue entries, arbitrate between databases, decide about responses
	commands -> Implement single-database actions
Rename imapfunctions
